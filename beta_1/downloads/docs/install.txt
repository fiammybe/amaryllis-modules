How to install Downloads
=========================

Downloads is installed as a regular ImpressCMS module, which means you should copy the complete /downloads folder into the /modules directory 
of your website. Then, log in to your site as administrator, go to System Admin > Modules, look for the downloads icon in the list of uninstalled 
modules and click in the install icon. Follow the directions in the screen and you'll be ready to go.

After successfull installation read manual first! You'll find the manual in ACP Menu of the Module.

Further you'll find a folder "extras" inside my module folder.There you can find :
* plugin for sitemap module -> copy the file inside sitemap/plugins folder to use sitemap with downloads
* plugin for waiting block -> copy the file to rootpath/plugins/waiting to make use of icms waiting block in ACP.
