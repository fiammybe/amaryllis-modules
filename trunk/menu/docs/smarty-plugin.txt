If the smarty plugin has successfully been copied to the smarty plugin folder (see install.txt) it can be used in the templates like:

* Go to ACP->Menu->Menu->Add Menu
* Add a menu with name "mymenu"
* Add links to the menu
edit your theme and add the smarty below:
	<{menu name="mymenu"}>

to override the given menu id from menu-object you might like to add the ID-Parameter:
	<{menu name="mymenu" id='myid'}>
