First of all, I wanna thank the ImpressCMS-Community, especially René Sato, QM-B, Bleekk, David and Pheonyx for supporting me.
For the CSS, I used parts of the Framework by bleekk, the cool_biz-theme and the sato_classic_01 by René Sato.

The Design is based on the psd-template "wp-magazine" which I found on http://xoops-theme.com

please keep these notes allways with the theme. Apart from this -> Feel free to edit the theme, like you want.
