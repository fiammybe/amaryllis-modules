How to install event
=========================

event is installed as a regular ImpressCMS module, which means you should copy the complete /event folder into the /modules directory of your website. Then, log in to your site as administrator, go to System Admin > Modules, look for the event icon in the list of uninstalled modules and click in the install icon. Follow the directions in the screen and you'll be ready to go.
