	      					Here you can choose, how often an album needs to be clicked, before it will marked as popular. If an Album is popular,
	      					you will see a small popular Icon and you can see it in the popular block. You can turn off this functionality by setting to 0</li>

	      				<li>Here you can enable/disable the comment function for single images. If the comments are turned on, registred users will see a comment field below every image inside the colorbox. So
	      					every user can comment the image. The system comment function will only be used for albums.</li>

	        		<ul>
	      				<li>If this option is set to "Yes", the comments will not be shown directly after posting. They will be marked as not apparoved and you will see them in the waiting block of impresscms.
	      					After you have approved the comment, it will be displayed. You also can set comments as not approved manually, if you like.</li>
	        		</ul>
	        	</li>
	        	<li>Do you need a field for adding an url to single images? <img style="vertical-align: middle" src="../images/updated.png" alt="new!" />
	        		<ul>
	        			<li>If set to yes, you will see a new field in images upload form, where you can enter a link to an external/internal site (product page, eternal shop etc.)</li>
	        		</ul>
	        	</li>

	        </ul>
	        <p>Perfectly! Preferences are done. The last preferences are system related: use the system comment system/notification system or even not. The system comment system will only be displayed for single Albums, to allow users/guests leave a comment for an Album.</p>
	        <h3 id="adjustindex">Adjust index page</h3>
	        <p>Now Let's have a look at the index Page. For this find the tab "Edit Indexpage" in Module Menu. Select the Index image, which you'd like to display on index or upload a new one using the image upload field. The Index image will be displayed on all module sites.</p>
	        <p>The Index header is just a header on module home, like the heading. It can be used for some more Text on module home to explain/invite guests to register and upload or whatever you like to.</p>
	        <p>The index footer is like the index image displayed on all sites of the module.</p>
	        <h3 id="firstalbum">Create your First Album</h3>
	        <p>Before you can upload any images you definately need to create an Album. Go to Tab "Manage Albums" and click "Add Album". Now you see the Form to create an Album. The First Album needs to be created on ACP, all other can also be created on frontend, if you like to.</p>
	        <p>Just fill the form. It's your first Album, so you can not chosse a Parent Album here. Select an album image or upload a new one. The Album Description will be displayed in a tooltip on index view and as a Description on single Album view. If sprockets Module is installed you will see a list of Tags. Select the related tags for this Album.</p>
	        <p>At least you can see several yes/no radio buttons. An album can only be visible on Frontend, if the following are set to yes:</p>
	        <ul>
	        	<li>Album Active (to set an Album online or offline)</li>
	        	<li>Album approve (like active, but more related if it is submitted from user side. In this case it can be disabled, but you will see it in waiting block as an Album awaiting approval)</li>
	        	<li>Album on index
	        		<ul>
	        			<li>A bit different to the both above. An album can be approved and active, but you don't want to display it. E.g.: Album can be used within other modules (like Downloads, Portfolio). Now you have an additional Album, which needs to be approved and also needs to be active. Otherwise it can not be used inside other modules.
	        				But also it's different to your gallery and you don't like to make it visible in gallery mode. Just set here to off, and it will be hidden from gallery.</li>
	        		</ul>
	        	</li>
	        </ul>
	        <p>Well done! You have created your first Album. Continue with adding images, now. Just fill the form on Tab "Manage Images" => "Add Image" and you're done. Just a few remarks:</p>
        	<h3 id="fillimages">Fill album with images</h3>
        	<ul>
        		<li>Image Description
        			<ul>
        				The image Description will be displayed behind the image inside colorbox on frontend. You can describe your image, give a Product overview or whatever else.
        			</ul>
        		</li>
        		<li>Image urllink
        			<ul>
        				<li>The Urllink will be displayed in colorbox, too. Here you can, if urllinks are enabled in module preferences, set a link to your product page or link with an external shop.</li>
        			</ul>
        		</li>
        		<li>Image Tags
        			<ul>
        				<li>Select the image related tags. A random notice: Tags will allways be displayed as a link, to filter all albums/images assigned to this tag.</li>
        			</ul>
        		</li>
        		<li>Image Copyright
        			<ul>
        				<li>If enabled in preferences you can enter a copyright text per image or use default one (both together is possible, too.. just allow default copyright and change if needed)
        					Select the Position and the color of the copyright and you're done. The copyright will be added by uploading/adding new images</li>
        			</ul>
        		</li>
        		<li>Additional informations, which are displayed on single index-view inside colorbox:
        			<ul>
        				<li>Submitter of the image</li>
        				<li>Published date or updated date, if it was updated</li>
        				<li>If the current visitor can edit/delete an icon to edit/delete the image</li>
        				<li>If you have enabled image comment system in module preferences and visitor has permissions: the comment box to add image comments</li>
        			</ul>
        		</li>
        	</ul>
        	<p>You have created your Album and filled up with some images? Go to module frontend and have a look.</p>
        	<h2 id="permissions">Permissions</h2>
        	<p>Let's go back to ACP and have a look at the permission system of Album Module. Got to Album Admin -> Tab "Permissions".</p>
        	<p>Here you can set several Permissions: View Permissions for single Albums will set the view permissions per user group to each album. Just select -> submit -> done.</p>
        	<p>The same for Images and Image submit permissions. Image submit permissions will allow each group, to upload images into a single album. On front end you can see a submit icon behind each album, where you have permissions to submit. Just click the icon, if you're using the Disclaimer -> accept. Now you can enter all informations. Album id will be set by the module related on the Album, where you're submitting.</p>
        	<p>Now the only Permissions, which are handled different and can not be set here: Album submit permissions. You need to enable this in Module Preferences -> "uploader groups". All selected groups will have permissions to create theier own albums.</p>
        	<h2 id="batchupload">Batchupload </h2>
        	<p>Currently the module has the possibility to upload multiple files via ftp into "uploads/album/batch/" or add multiple images with zip file upload. Go to ACP Tab "Batchupload". At First select the target Album.
        		 If you selected to add images from batch, check all images to add, otherwise upload a zip folder. Enter a description, select tags, if sprockets module is installed and enabled, enter copyright text or use default, enter the urllink.</p>
        	<p>Click on "Submit" to apply batch. All images will now be moved to "uploads/album/images/" and added to database. If copyrights, urrlink, tags are enabled, it will all be done at once.</p>
        	<h2 id="messages">Comment System for single images <img style="vertical-align: middle" src="../images/updated.png" alt="new!" /></h2>
        	<p>If allowed in preferences, you can have a small message/comment system in Album images. If allowed, you'll see a textarea field behind each image. Here users (highly recommanded not to allow guests writing comments..) can add a comment to the picture inside colorbox, which will be visible directly behind the image. Album comments are visible inside an album and are managed in impresscms. The image comments can be managed by you inside the module.
        		</p>
        	<h2 id="blocks">Module Blocks</h2>
        	<p>Currently the Module has two Blocks:</p>
        	<ul>
        		<li>Album Menu Block
        			<ul>
        				<li>The Album Menu Block just displays a simple list of Albums. You can select a single Album, to display only subalbums or even select, if the block should display subalbums or even not.</li>
        			</ul>
        		</li>
        		<li>Recent Images Block
        			<ul>
        				<li>The recent images block displays the recent images, but you have some options to select, which images should be displayed:
        					<ul>
        						<li>Limit: Enter the number of images to be shown in the block</li>
        						<li>Album: Select an album, to display only images of one Album</li>
        						<li>Publisher: Select a publisher, to display only the images of the selected publisher. Select Anonymous to display from all Publishers</li>
        						<li>Sort/Order: Sort/order the images by..</li>
        						<li>Display size/height to scale the images for the block</li>
        						<li>Horizontal: If set to yes, the image scrolling is horizontal, else vertcal</li>
        						<li>Autoscroll: Set yes to enable autoscroll, no to disable.</li>
        					</ul>
        				</li>
        				<li>Currently the image Block doesn't display all image informations. You need some more? No problem, just use the smarty-variables like I used in /album/templates/album_images.html.
        					 This is the template for single images on frontend. All smartys begin here with a <code>$album_images.</code> and in block template the same can be used within the foreach.
        					  Just replace <code>$album_images. </code> with <code>$image. </code> and just keep the phrase behind the point. E.g.: <code>$album_images.title</code> goes to be
        					  <code>$image.title</code></li>
        			</ul>
        		</li>
        	</ul>
        	<h2 id="templates">Templates</h2>
        	<p>There's a long list of Templates available and I'll try to give a short overview:</p>
        	<ul>
        		<li>/album_admin.html
        			<ul>
        				<li>contains all necessary variables to display admin-side. Less informations enough, and I think, most people will never use this template for changes ;-)</li>
        			</ul>
        		</li>
        		<li>/album_requirements.html
        			<ul>
        				<li>The same: only an admin template and will only be used, if the requirements check failed on installation.</li>
        			</ul>
        		</li>
        		<li>/album_index.html
        			<ul>
        				<li>Most relevant part: contains the whole index. If you're calling module home, a single album or a list of images by Publisher/Tags it will be displayed using this Template. It
        					also includes several other templates, but this is the "Main Template"</li>
        			</ul>
        		</li>
        		<li>/album_header.html
        			<ul>
        				<li>Header Template. Contains Breadcrumb and index image of the module. Here is also the module css file linked, if you like to include the styles in your theme, remove the link.</li>
        			</ul>
        		</li>
        		<li>/album_footer.html
        			<ul>
        				<li>Footer Template: contains the module footer, a link to ACP, if you're an Admin, system comment rule displayed on single album view and notification system.</li>
        			</ul>
        		</li>
        		<li>/album_album.html
        			<ul>
        				<li>Contains all single albums in an album loop. It's the same, if you're on module home or you got displayed sub albums inside a single album. For each Album this template will be included.</li>
        			</ul>
        		</li>
        		<li>/album_images.html
        			<ul>
        				<li>The same for images: all images in a loop will be displayed by including this template. It contains a single image and all other informations inside a colorbox.</li>
        			</ul>
        		</li>
        		<li>/album_forms.html
        			<ul>
        				<li>Displays upload/submit forms for creating an album or uploading a new image on frontend.</li>
        			</ul>
        		</li>
        	</ul>
