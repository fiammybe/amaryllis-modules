        <h1>Article Manual</h1>
        	<p>Article is an article handling module for ImpressCMS.</p>
        <h2>Keyfeatures</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>You can write articles</li>
				<li>You can categorize your articles</li>
				<li>Attach files to your articles.</li>
				<li>Use simple method to paginate your articles</li>
			</ul>
        <h2>First Start</h2>
			<p>There are several things you should do <b>before</b> you try to create a new article. Please, follow the instructions.</p>
			
			<h3>Allow the necessary File types</h3>
			
				<p>At first we need to allow the Mime types, which can be uploaded. Go to System > Media > Mime Types</p>
				<p>Choose the Mime types you want to allow for File upload. If you like to use file upload from frontend beware of the group permissions per file.</p>
				<p>Remember the image upload, too. Actually the mime type permissions are used by the image upload, too. So please allow also jpeg, jpg, png and whatever you like to use.</p>
				<p>Done! Now you can upload all file types.</p>
		
			<h3>Check out the module preferences</h3>
				<p>There might be some preferences, you'd like to change before using the module first time. Go to Modules > Article > Preferences</p>
				<p>Choose the preferences like preferred. Think, most preferences should be explained enough.</p>
				<p>Done! Next step.</p>
			<h3>Create a category</h3>
				<p>The next important will be creating a category. Otherwise you can not see the page to submit articles. Go to Tab 'Manage categories' > Add Category. Just Fill out the fields. You can select an image for the category or upload a new one. You also can upload a set of new category images to /uploads/article/categoryimages/. The module will read the image files inside the folder and show them inside the select box. Done.</p>
			<h3>Submit Articles</h3>
				<p>Finally you can start creating articles. Go to Tab 'Manage Articles' > 'Add Article' and fill out the fields. Done! Now you should see your first category and article inside the frontend.</p>
