How to install menu
=========================

Menu is installed as a regular ImpressCMS module, which means you should copy the complete /menu folder into the /modules directory of your website.
 Then, log in to your site as administrator, go to System Admin > Modules, look for the menu icon in the list of uninstalled modules and click in the
 install icon. Follow the directions in the screen and you'll be ready to go.

To use the smarty plugin get sure the file /extras/function.menu.php has been copied to ROOT/libraries/smarty/icms_plugins/. If the installer script has no permissions,
copy the file manually.
