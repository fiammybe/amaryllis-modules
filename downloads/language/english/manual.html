	        <h2 id="downloads_keyfeatures">Keyfeatures</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>You can upload files to make them public your website or to share them with user groups.</li>
					<li>You can categorize your files</li>
					<li>Describe your file: key features, requirements, history, license, some screenshots and a lot more!</li>
					<li>Bind "Downloads" to use with other modules. Currently:
						<ul>
							<li>"Album" Module to include image sets</li>
							<li>"Catalogue" Module to sell your files</li>
							<li>"Sprockets" Module for tag support</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
	        <h2 id="downloads_firststart">First Start</h2>
				<p>There are several things you should do <b>before</b> you try to upload a new file. Please, follow the instructions.</p>
				
				<h3 id="downloads_mimetypes">Allow the necessary File types</h3>
					<p>The Mime Types will be handled by the system, not by the module itself. Therefore we need to allow the needed mime types for the "Downloads"-Module and the groups, before we can upload files.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Go to <b>System => Media => Mime Types</b>.
							 Here you will find the System Mime Type Handler.</li>
						<li>Choose the Mime Types you want to allow for file upload. If you like to use file upload from front end beware of
							 the group permissions per file. You need to select the Downloads Module to be allowed and the Groups, which you want to allow, too.</li>
						<li>Remember the image upload, too. Actually the mime type permissions are used by the image upload, too. So please allow also jpeg, jpg, png and whatever you like to use.</li>
						<li>Done! Now you can upload all file types you have allowed.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Done! Next step.</p>
			
			<div id="downloads_backtop"><a href="#manual_top">Back to top</a></div>
			<div class="downloads_clear_right">&nbsp;</div>
			
				<h3 id="downloads_indexpage">Adjust index page</h3>
	        		<p>Now Let's have a look at the index Page. For this find the tab "Edit Indexpage" in Module Menu. Select the Index image, which you'd like to display on index or upload a new one using the image upload field. The Index image will be displayed on all module sites.</p>
			        <p>The Index header is just a header on module home, like the heading. It can be used for some more Text on module home to explain/invite guests to register and upload or whatever you like to.</p>
			        <p>The index footer is like the index image displayed on all sites of the module.</p>
				<h3 id="create_categories">Create a category</h3>
					<p>The next most important step would be creating a category. Otherwise you can not see the file upload page. Go to Tab 'Manage categories' > Add Category. Just Fill out the fields. You can select an image for the category or upload a new one. You also can upload a set of new category images to /uploads/downloads/categoryimages/. The module will read the image files inside the folder and show them inside the select box. Done.</p>
				<h3 id="upload_files">Upload Files</h3>
					<p>Finally you can start uploading files. Go to Tab 'Manage Files' > 'Add File' and fill out the fields. Done! Now you should see your first category and file inside the frontend.</p>
				<h3 id="downloads_reviews">Reviews and Log</h3>
					<p>The review system is just to add reviews in frontend. You can edit them, if necessary in module ACP, but you will not be allowed to add new one. Please, use frontend to add reviews. Also the reviews doesn't have a real permission controll. You may disable adding for guests, so they will get a popup-message to register or login for submitting a review.</p>
					<p>For Log System it's a bit more strange: You cannot add Log items and you'll be not allowed to change fields. It's just for logging and statistics. If you have an spammer problem you can get the IP to bann the sammer from your site.</p>

							<li>The "Recent Files" block will display the recently uploaded files and sort them by published date, DESC.</li>
						</ul>

						</ul>

						</ul>
					</li>

							<li>The Gallery Block will display recent uploaded files. The Block requires a file image. If the Block doesn't has a file image, the file won't be displayed.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>You can clone all blocks, if needed.</p>

			<div class="downloads_clear_right">&nbsp;</div>
			
			<h2 id="downloads_import">Import from Wf-Downloads</h2>
				<p>The module contains an import script for Wf-Downloads. A few things, before you start importing:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>If you're updating an older site and you also like to use article and import from news(old)/smartsection, make sure, you first use the import of article before importing wfd data.</li>
					<li>Make sure, it's a clean "Downloads" installation. It might be difficult if you have created categories/downloads first.</li>
					<li>You will loose your old voting and metainformation data</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Ok, let's start. It's easy enough.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>At first: you will need to uninstall Wf-Downloads before importing. Make a backup of ALL WF Downloads tables first.</li>
					<li>After successfully updated system you can install "Downloads". Don't forget now to import your sql file.</li>
					<li>Importer will find the tables itself and present you the buttons. Start with first button and click them step by step.</li>
					<li>Don't worry, if the waiting time is a bit longer. For an import of about 4000 Entries in another module I needed to wait nearly 2 minutes!</li>
					<li>Check, if all categories/files are present and there are no mistakkes.</li>
